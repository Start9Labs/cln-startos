    READ CAREFULLY! Core Lightning and the Lightning Network are considered beta software. Please use with caution and do not
    risk more money than you are willing to lose. We encourage frequent backups. If for any reason, you need to restore
    c-lightning from a backup, your on-chain wallet will be restored, but the money locked up in your channels will be
    stuck in those channels for an indeterminate period of time, if they are returned to you at all. It depends on the
    cooperation of your peers. Choose peers with discretion.
  uninstall: |
    READ CAREFULLY! Uninstalling Core Lightning will result in permanent loss of data, including its private keys for its
    on-chain wallet and all channel states. Please make a backup if you have any funds in your on-chain wallet or in any
    channels. Recovering from backup will restore your on-chain wallet, but due to the architecture of the Lightning
    Network, your channels cannot be recovered. All your channel funds will be stuck in those channels for an indeterminate
    period of time, and if your peers do not cooperate, they will not be recoverable at all.
  restore: |
    Restoring Core Lightning will overwrite its current data, including its on-chain wallet and channels. Any channels opened
    since the last backup will be forgotten and may linger indefinitely, and channels contained in the backup will be
    closed and their funds returned to your wallet, assuming your peers choose to cooperate.
